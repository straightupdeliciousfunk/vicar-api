# vicar-api

Download the main VICAR source code tarball from NASA repo here: https://github.com/nasa/VICAR/ 

You need to add the vicset1 and vicset2 scripts to vos's .cshrc folder so all the environment variables are setup correctly. Once that's done you can run vicar from the command line or with docker exec.

TODO: add more detail, and upload the docker run command with X11 so xvd run from the docker container launches a graphics window on the host computer
